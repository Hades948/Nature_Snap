Nature Snap is a simple game where you can wonder through the wilderness and take
pictures of animals that you find along the way.  Be on the lookout for squirrels; 
they like to hide.  Although, I've heard they have a secret hideout somewhere in
the forrest where they go to have squirrel parties.
